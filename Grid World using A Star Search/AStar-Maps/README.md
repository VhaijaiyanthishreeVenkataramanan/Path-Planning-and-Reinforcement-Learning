The existing text files for A* maps are given in this directory.
If you would like to create a new map file, please remember to save it in the same directory. You should save it as a text file. 
Here's an example for a 8 x 8 grid:

0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0 

0  0  0  0  0  1  3  0 

0  0  0  0  1  0  4  0

0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0 

0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0

0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0

2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 

where, 1 is the obstacle (Ghost in this case), 2 in the starting position (the position where Ninja Robot is placed in this case), 3 is the goal (saving the Crying Person), 4 is the haunted house
